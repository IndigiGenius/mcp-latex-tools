# MCP Protocol Debugging Notes

## Current Issue Summary
The MCP LaTeX Tools server core functionality is perfect (100% working), but the MCP protocol layer isn't responding to Claude Code properly.

## What Works ✅
- All 4 LaTeX tools function perfectly when called directly
- Fast compilation (0.29s LaTeX→PDF)
- Comprehensive error handling
- 85% test suite pass rate
- Modern Python architecture with UV

## What's Broken ❌
- MCP server doesn't respond to initialization requests
- JSON-RPC protocol handshake failing
- Claude Code cannot connect to server

## Technical Details

### Error Fixed
```python
# OLD (causing error):
capabilities=server.get_capabilities(),

# NEW (fixed):
capabilities=server.get_capabilities(
    notification_options=None,
    experimental_capabilities={}
),
```

### Current MCP Dependencies
```toml
dependencies = [
    "mcp>=1.11.0",
    "pypdf>=4.0.0",
]
```

### Test Results
- **Direct tool test**: ✅ All pass (test_tools_directly.py)
- **MCP protocol test**: ❌ No response (test_mcp_server.py)

## Debugging Strategy for Next Session

### 1. Check MCP Library Compatibility
```bash
uv run python -c "import mcp; print(mcp.__version__)"
```

### 2. Minimal MCP Server Test
Create the simplest possible MCP server to test protocol basics.

### 3. Compare with Working Examples
Look at official MCP server examples for proper initialization patterns.

### 4. Protocol Version Check
Verify we're using the correct MCP protocol version (currently using "2024-11-05").

## Expected Fix Impact
Once the protocol layer works, Claude Code will be able to:
- List available LaTeX tools
- Compile LaTeX documents directly
- Validate syntax and extract PDF metadata
- Support research document development workflows

## Success Test
```python
# This should work once fixed:
# 1. Start MCP server
# 2. Claude Code connects successfully  
# 3. Claude Code can call compile_latex tool
# 4. LaTeX document compiles to PDF
# 5. Research workflow is enabled
```
